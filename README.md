## Getting Started

Our primary development will focus on Android because it is more accessible for those using Windows OSes. That being said, this is not a limiting factor and iOS app development can be done concurrently with Flutter.

Download the following for Android App Development:
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup).
2. [The Flutter extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter).
3. [Android Studio 2](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) to debug and compile Java or Kotlin code for Android. Flutter requires the full version of Android Studio.
4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
